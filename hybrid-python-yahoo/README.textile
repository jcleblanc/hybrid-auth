h2. Yahoo! OpenID / OAuth Hybrid Auth Sample Code

The sample code contained in this project is intended to be used to capture the private Yahoo! profile of a user using OpenID with the OAuth hybrid extension.  This project contains several files that are required for integration:
* app.yaml - The Google App Engine config file
* index.py - The form allowing the user to input the OpenID provider URI that they would like to use
* common.py - Common variables
* auth.py - Initiates the hybrid auth request
* complete.py - Completes the hybrid auth request

To use this sample:
* Create a new OAuth (not YAP) application on Yahoo! at https://developer.apps.yahoo.com/projects
* Modify common.py with your consumer key and secret obtained from the application
* You may load the application within Google App Engine using the app.yaml file or load it through any other means
* Load index.py to initiate the process

Dependencies:
This sample code uses the following two libraries:
* OAuth (oauth folder): The Leah Culver OAuth library obtained from http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/python/oauth/
* OpenID (openid folder): The JanRain OpenID library obtained from http://www.janrain.com/openid-enabled
